It is the day of the last lab session of DS
I think I did quite well for this course. Hence, I am quite satisfied with my performance. 
However, I still think there some parts where I can still improve and do better.
Throughout this course I learn more about Java and Data Structure.
There is'nt any change in my target grade.
I did well in attending every class and complete all tutorials, labs and assignments on time.
It would be better if I pay more attention on the details when doing lab and assignments.
