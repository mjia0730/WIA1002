My name is OOI JIA MING with matrix number, U2102759. I am
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because I can learn something new.
I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will pay attention during lecture and complete all tutorials, 
labs and assignments. Wish me luck!!!

 It is the day of the last lab session of DS.
 I think I did quite well for this course.
 Hence, I am quite satisfied with my performance.
 However, I still think there some parts where I can still improve and do better.
 Throughout this course I learn more about Java and Data Structure.
 There is'nt any change in my target grade.
 I did well in attending every class and complete all tutorials, labs and assignments on time.
 It would be better if I pay more attention on the details when doing lab and assignments.
